# Suoni Per Il Popolo Archive

Located in Montreal, Quebec, Suoni Per Il Popolo has been a leading festival of the avant-garde arts since the year 2000. Every June the festival showcases underground experimental performers from genres such as free jazz, noise, drone, avant-folk, art-rock, electronics, and more.

I noticed that the official Suoni website has an archive going back to 2021, but all the events for the 21 years prior remain a mystery. As such, I created a searchable database of all performers and events for the Suoni Per Il Popolo festival. The data has been manually entered through old festival programmes, and I will continue to update the site as more programmes and data sets become available to me.

You can view the list of artists and events by Year, Venue, or Artist Name. There's also a search bar that will return a query of artist names. I invite you to leave comments on event page, such as memories from the event, set lists, posters, photos, video links, etc.
